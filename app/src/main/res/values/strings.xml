        <![CDATA[<p><b>Quick Guide: </b>Pick a mode and press that save button and reboot to begin your adventure!</p>

        <p><b>DPI: </b>DPI stands for Dots Per Inch. The smaller DPI is, the smaller the text and icons become and
        the larger your screen gets. Simple as that.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Device Default: </b>DPI you were using when you first entered this app. Used for restoring!<br />
            <b>Small Phone Mode: </b>Now isn\'t your phone small? Actually I would not recommend you to set a DPI
            higher than this value, unless you would like to get some real fun.<br />
            <b>Large Phone Mode: </b>Now you have a large-sized phone! Isn\'t that great?<br />
            <b>Small Tablet Mode: </b>Now you have a 7-inch tablet! Some of the tablet features should be unlocked now,
            and if you happened to be using Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich, you\'ve unlocked ALL the tablet features
            now!<br />
            <b>Large Tablet Mode: </b>Now you have a 10-inch tablet! ALL THE TABLET FEATURES IS UNLOCKED in this mode!
            Isn\'t that great?
        </p>

        <p>And finally, <b>the Customization</b>! With this mode, you can change your DPI to whatever you want.
        Please note that if you picked a DPI between Small Tablet Mode and Large Tablet Mode,
        the Small Tablet Mode will be triggered, if you picked a DPI between Phone Modes and Small Tablet Mode,
        the Phone Modes will be triggered.</p>]]>
